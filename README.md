# LEGOLANG

An upcoming buzzword language created in early 2019 to promote the use of grammar and LotR references in code. Legolang has support for _everything_ you need to do computations, (specifically limited to integers) allowing for more freedom for the developer to express themselves in their code and learn more about the lands of Middle Earth _all while coding!_.

## Features

Characters are created by dictating 
    Frodo is a hobbit

We currently have support for _hobbit, elf, dwarf, orc and wizard_
